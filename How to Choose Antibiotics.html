      <p>Antibiotics are prescribed according to the Five Rights, Five rights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right patient</li>
        <li>Right drug</li>
        <li>Right dose</li>
        <li>Right route</li>
        <li>Right duration</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Right patient</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The right patient: confirm presence of infection; fever, CBC, special test;;; fever is hallmark of every bacterial infection of 37.2 C except if patient is immunocompromised and fever does not always mean patient have infection ;;; CBC you look for WBC (5000- 10000), neutrophil 60%- 70% of WBC and it fight bacteria , lymphocytes 30% fight viruses and TB, eosinophil 4-10% allergic or parasitic infection , basophil &lt;1% it elevates in leukemia and lymphoma ;;; specific test =&gt; you</li>
        <li>You approach is that you determine if there Is a fever or no and what caused the fever like infectious cause, cancer .. You want to confirm you do CBC and specific test</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Right drug</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Right drug: when we choosing the right drug we need to consider type infective organism, patient factors, tissue penetration</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Identification of infective organism</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1- ideally you want to know the infective organism (you take infective material and you send it to lab) like CSF fluid specimen if you sus meningitis and you send for culture and sensitivity ; urine if you sus UTI =&gt; lab would tell you the infective organism and what drugs it is susceptible for</li>
        <li>But sometimes you give antibiotic without knowing the infective organism and that is what we call empirical therapy and we only give empirical therapy in acutely ill patient because the culture and sens takes 2-3 days and you can’t wait that long with these patients;;; also you give empirical therapy in patients who have neutropenia (&lt;5000) because these patients are immunocompromised;;; and you give empirical therapy in patients who have meningitis (usually have severe headache, photosensitivity, neck rigidity) you give penicillin for these patients and then you take CSF for culture and sensitivity</li>
        <li>When selecting empirical therapy drug you want to take into consideration site of infection and patient’s history (previous infections, age, recent travel hx, recent antimicrobial therapy, immune status, whether infection is hospital or community acquired)</li>
        <li>2- patient factors: some antibiotics can’t be used in some age groups; neonates can’t be give chloramphenicol or sulfonamide, chloramphenicol cause grey baby syndrome, sulfonamides cause kernicterus;; children can’t be given tetracyclines cause abnormal teeth formation (dental enamel hypoplasia), fluoroquinolones cause articular damage;;; old age can’t be given aminoglycosides because it cause severe nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity ;;; pregnant patient can’t take aminoglycosides cause congenital deafness, fluroquinolones it pass placenta and cause articular damage; immunocompromised patient can’t take bacteriostatic drugs because they arrest growth and wait for immune system to clear bacteria but this patient is already immunocompromised so no point of giving that;;; people with renal dysfunction need dose adjustment and careful monitoring of the concentration so the drug does not accumulate same for hepatic dysfunction</li>
        <li>3- tissue penetration: antibiotic must reach site of infection so the infection get irradicated. in case of chronic abscess – antibiotic can’t go through the lining of the abscess because it is fibrous tissue so no point of giving antibiotics ;;; diabetic foot there is ischemia so antibiotic can’t reach the ischemic parts unless excision and debridement of the ischemic part ;;; natural barriers like blood brain barrier, blood eye barrier, blood prostate barrier; in case of blood brain barrier you give the drug intrathecally or being able to cross that barrier (high lipid solubility, low molecular weight)</li>
        <li>In summary regarding right drug we explained that we need to know that type of organism through culture and sensitivity of the infected material and you make sure that the drug you want to use is good for your patient age group and health condition and you make sure that the drug you want to choose is going to reach the tissue infected</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Right dose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimal inhibitory concentration: minimum concentration of antibiotic required to inhibit the microorganism; below MIC antibiotic unable to kill bacteria;;; and according to the MIC antibiotics categorized into</li>
        <li>Concentration dependent killing: antibiotic kills the microorganism more when concentration increased like gentamicin from aminoglycosides so it is given in high oral doses compared to others (80, 160mg)</li>
        <li>Time dependent killing: killing of microorganism more if antibiotic stayed in circulation more like penicillin so it is given more frequently like 4 times a day every 6 hours</li>
        <li>Post antibiotic effect: some antibiotic still have the killing effect even if its concentration in plasma diminished because it is aggregated in the infection sites and inside microphages like fluoroquinolones that aggregates in infection sites and macrolides (azithromycin)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Right route</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Patients with severe infection better given antibiotics parenterally</li>
        <li>Mild infections better with oral</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Right duration</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every infection have treatment duration that is already allocated by general guidelines</li>
        <li>Acute rhinosinusitis is 5 days duration of treatment; acute otitis media 5- 7 days, community acquired pneumonia 5- 7 days</li>
        <li>After complete resolution it is better to continue the antibiotic for another 2- 3 days to prevent relapse</li>
        <li>And if relapse happen then the infection is back and bacteria is resistant towards the antibiotic you already used</li>
      </ul>
