  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>Antipsychotics also known as Neuroleptics.</p>
  <p>Drugs that block the dopamine receptors in the central nervous system.</p>
  <p>They used in treatment of psychosis and schizophrenia.</p>
  <p>To understand antipsychotics, first we need to understand psychosis and schizophrenia and how they happen.</p>
</section>

<section id="psychosis">
  <h2>Psychosis</h2>
  <p>Psychosis is a set of symptoms that occurs due to many medical and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, psychotic depression, delirium.</p>
  <p>Psychosis is characterized by loss in the perception of reality in the affected person (living in a type of dream).</p>
  <p>Psychosis symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delusions: false unshakable beliefs (could be persecutory or grandiose)</li>
    <li>Hallucinations: false perception of external stimuli (could be auditory, visual, gustatory, smelling..)</li>
    <li>Disorganized thought: content and form of thoughts</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="schizophrenia">
  <h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
  <p>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of psychosis, cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms.</p>
  <p>Schizophrenia is associated with positive symptoms (psychotic symptoms): delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought and abnormal behavior.</p>
  <p>Schizophrenia associated with cognitive impairment in form of difficulty processing information, decreased attention and troubles with memory.</p>
  <p>It is also associated with negative symptoms in form of poverty of speech, social isolation, lack of motivation and inability to feel pleasure.</p>
  <p>Schizophrenia symptoms are caused by increase dopamine levels in some dopaminergic pathways.</p>
  <p>Now, let’s explain the dopaminergic pathways and how they are affected by schizophrenia and antipsychotics.</p>
</section>

<section id="dopaminergic-pathways">
  <h2>Dopaminergic Pathways</h2>
  <p>There is 4 major dopamine pathways in the brain, they include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Mesolimbic pathway</li>
    <li>Mesocortical pathway</li>
    <li>Nigrostriatal pathway</li>
    <li>Tuberoinfundibular pathway</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section id="mesolimbic">
  <h3>Mesolimbic Pathway</h3>
  <p>Transmit dopamine from ventral tegmental area in the midbrain to the ventral striatum (formed by nucleus accumbens and olfactory bulb).</p>
  <p>Mesolimbic pathway functions related to reward cognition (wanting response, pleasure response from certain stimuli) and aversion cognition (strong dislike).</p>
  <p>Increasing dopamine levels in the mesolimbic pathway lead to psychosis and schizophrenia.</p>
  <p>Antipsychotics block dopamine in this pathway to control psychotic symptoms.</p>
</section>

<section id="mesocortical">
  <h3>Mesocortical Pathway</h3>
  <p>Mesocortical pathway transmits dopamine from the ventral tegmental area to the frontal cortex.</p>
  <p>Mesocortical pathways related to executive functions.</p>
  <p>Increasing the dopamine levels in the mesocortical pathway lead to schizophrenia.</p>
  <p>Antipsychotics block dopamine in this pathway to control psychotic symptoms.</p>
</section>

<section id="nigrostriatal">
  <h3>Nigrostriatal Pathway</h3>
  <p>Nigrostriatal pathway transmits dopamine from substantia nigra to the caudate nucleus and putamen (all these are parts of the basal ganglia).</p>
  <p>Nigrostriatal pathway related to motor functions, reward related cognition and associative learning.</p>
  <p>Decreasing the levels of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to extrapyramidal side effects similar to Parkinson’s disease.</p>
  <p>Parkinson’s is a movement disorder characterized by tremors, dyskinesia, cogwheel rigidity, stooped posture and shuffling gait (explained more in adverse effects chapter of this video).</p>
  <p>When antipsychotics blocks dopamine, it also block it in this pathway leading to Parkinson’s like symptoms.</p>
</section>

<section id="tuberoinfundibular">
  <h3>Tuberoinfundibular Pathway</h3>
  <p>Transmits dopamine from hypothalamus to the pituitary gland.</p>
  <p>This pathway function is to regulate prolactin secretion.</p>
  <p>If dopamine levels decrease in this pathway, this lead to hyperprolactinemia.</p>
  <p>Antipsychotics block dopamine in this pathway, thus leading to hyperprolactinemia.</p>
  <p>This lead to side effects like decrease libido, sexual dysfunction, infertility.</p>
</section>

<section id="classification">
  <h2>Classification of Antipsychotics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Typical antipsychotics (AKA old antipsychotics, first gen antipsychotics), developed in 1950s
      <ul>
        <li>Chlorpromazine</li>
        <li>Haloperidol</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Atypical antipsychotics (AKA new antipsychotics, second gen antipsychotics), developed in 1970s
      <ul>
        <li>Risperidone</li>
        <li>Olanzapine</li>
        <li>Clozapine (used in resistant cases)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="mechanism-typical">
  <h2>Mechanism of Action of Typical Antipsychotics</h2>
  <p>They block a lot of receptors, mainly dopamine D2 receptors.</p>
  <p>That is why they are more likely to be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms like tremors and dyskinesia.</p>
</section>

<section id="mechanism-atypical">
  <h2>Mechanism of Action of Atypical Antipsychotics</h2>
  <p>They block the dopamine D2 receptors but to lesser degree than typicals do, they also block the serotonin 5HT receptors, muscarinic and alpha adrenergic receptors.</p>
  <p>They are associated with lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms that typical antipsychotics.</p>
  <p>With the use of atypicals, there is high risk of metabolic adverse effects, such as weight gain, hypercholesterolemia and DM.</p>
</section>

<section id="therapeutic-uses">
  <h2>Therapeutic Uses</h2>
  <p>Both typicals and atypicals are used in schizophrenia, atypicals are used as the first line nowadays because they produce less extrapyramidal symptoms, but typicals has much better efficacy that atypicals in managing schizophrenia positive symptoms.</p>
  <p>Cases where there is no sufficient response to typicals and atypicals (refractory cases) then clozapine is used (watch for bone marrow suppression).</p>
  <p>Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are better managed with the atypicals.</p>
  <p>Chlorpromazine sometimes used to relieve intractable hiccups.</p>
  <p>Typicals are used in treatment of severe nausea and vomiting because they block dopamine D2 receptors in chemoreceptor trigger zone in medulla.</p>
  <p>Antipsychotics also used in treatment of agitation and aggressive behavior secondary to other disorders (e.g. autism).</p>
  <p>Pimozide (typical antipsychotic) is indicated for treatment of tics in Tourette disorder.</p>
  <p>Antipsychotics also used in management of manic and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder.</p>
  <p>Paliperidone (atypical) used in treatment of schizoaffective disorder.</p>
  <p>Antipsychotics also used in treatment of depression refractory to antidepressants and other treatment lines.</p>

<section id="adverse-effects">
  <h2>Adverse Effects</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Extrapyramidal manifestation:</strong> those occur as a result of blocking Dopamine D2 receptors in nigrostriatal pathway (in the basal ganglia), they include:
      <ul>
        <li>Tremor: shaking movements</li>
        <li>Rigidity (hypertonia): resistance to passive movement</li>
        <li>Dystonia</li>
        <li>Akathisia</li>
        <li>Dyskinesia</li>
        <li>Dystonia: sustained muscle contractions, usually occurs within few hours to days of the treatment</li>
        <li>Akathisia: inability to remain still</li>
        <li>Rigidity and tremor occur within weeks to months after starting treatment</li>
        <li>Dyskinesia: involuntary repetitive muscle movement, that occur with long term treatment with antipsychotics</li>
        <li>The extrapyramidal manifestations can be treated by administration of anticholinergic drug that work on CNS (benztropine)</li>
        <li>Akathisia respond better to beta blockers (e.g. propranolol)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome:</strong> Serious complication with mortality rate of 20%. Occur with typical antipsychotics. Present as autonomic disturbance in form of muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, high blood pressure, sweating and myoglobinemia. Treatment with stopping of the antipsychotic and supportive.
    </li>
    <li>Hyperprolactinemia occur more with typical antipsychotics, and it lead to sexual dysfunction, gynecomastia and amenorrhea</li>
    <li>Antipsychotics blocks alpha receptors leading to postural hypotension and light headedness, this occur especially with atypical antipsychotics</li>
    <li>Some antipsychotics block muscarinic receptors (chlorpromazine, clozapine and olanzapine) leading to anticholinergic effects like blurred vision, dry mouth, confusion and constipation</li>
    <li>Weight gain, hyperglycemia more with atypical antipsychotics because of 5HT receptor blockage</li>
    <li>Clozapine lead to agranulocytosis</li>
    <li>Cardiac arrhythmias with chlorpromazine</li>
    <li>Cholestatic jaundice</li>
  </ol>

<section id="cautions">
  <h2>Cautions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Antipsychotics may increase seizures in seizure disorders patients</li>
    <li>They carry increased mortality if used in elderly patients with dementia and psychosis</li>
    <li>They may lead to suicidal ideation or behaviors if used in mood disorders patients</li>
