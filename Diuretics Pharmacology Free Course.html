      <p>To understand diuretics first we need to learn the ion and water exchange in the nephron</p>
      <p>Diuretics are drugs that make kidney lose water and to make it lose water, we need to make lose sodium first because salt and water moves together. We have five diuretics groups: loop diuretics, Thiazides, Potassium sparing diuretics, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, osmotic diuretics…</p>
      <p>To understand how diuretics works, first we need to learn the ion and water exchange in the nephron (functional unit of kidney), so the upcoming paragraphs are going to explain the exchange that happen in each segment of the nephron and which diuretic would affect that…</p>
      <p>Normally, blood enters the nephron from the afferent arteriole to the glomerular tuft into the efferent arteriole, the blood will undergo filtration process by the glomerular basement membrane into the bowman’s capsule and it’s powered by the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the blood vessels walls. The filtrate contain water, different organic compounds, ions except for the proteins. The speed of filtration is about 120 ml/min and that would convert into 173 L per day (by multiplying it by 60 min and 24 hours) and 99% of this is reabsorbed again and that’s why our urine volume don’t exceed 1.5 L/day…</p>

                <li>65% of filtered sodium is actively reabsorbed by the PCT cells and the water moves with the sodium (because salt and water moves together) so we get the same amount of water (65%) reabsorbed through the PCT.</li>
                <li>Also in the PCT potassium, bicarbonate, hydrogen, amino acids, organic compounds and some of the calcium and magnesium are reabsorbed.</li>
                <li>Also secretion process occur in the PCT of some compounds like uric acid which is reabsorbed again.</li>

                <li>The ascending part of the loop is impermeable to water and the descending part is going to reabsorb 25% of water as compensation to the sodium reabsorbed by the ascending part (in total loop will absorb 25% sodium and water).</li>
