  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Synthesized in 1939, by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, the intention was to create anticholinergic agent, but the invention worked as anticholinergic and also as analgesic</li>
      <li>Meperidine was the first totally synthetic opioid</li>
      <li>Opioid agonist with anti muscarinic effect opposite to morphine which had muscarinic effects</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Meperidine is the scientific name, pethidine is the trade name</li>
      <li>Synthetic opioid from the phenylpiperidine family (meperidine is the prototype agent of this family)</li>
      <li>Compared to morphine, pethidine carries equal risk of addiction and it is more toxic because its metabolite (norpethidine) was found to have serotonergic effects so it leads to serotonin syndrome</li>
      <li>One of the most commonly used opioids</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Classification of opioids</h2>

  <section>
    <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Available as IM, sub cut, IV and oral syrup</li>
      <li>Better absorbed orally and has greater bioavailability (50%) than morphine</li>
      <li>Metabolized to norpethidine which is neurotoxic leading to activation of serotonin receptors (may lead to serotonin syndrome)</li>
      <li>Excreted through liver and kidney, its half life is 8- 12 hours</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pethidine work as an opioid receptors especially mu opioids receptors in central nervous system and peripheral tissues and it work as agonist on these receptors</li>
      <li>Pethidine has structural similarities to atropine, that is why it work also as anticholinergic</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Pharmacologic effects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Analgesic potency is 10% of morphine</li>
      <li>Activation of these opioid receptors lead to several central effects (CNS effects):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Analgesia</li>
        <li>Euphoria</li>
        <li>Sedation</li>
        <li>Respiratory depression</li>
        <li>Cough suppression</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Pruritus</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Activation of these opioid receptors lead to several peripheral effects including:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>CVS</li>
        <li>GIT: constipation</li>
        <li>RS</li>
        <li>Urinary system: may lead to urine retention</li>
        <li>Immune: decrease immunity</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Therapeutic uses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Meperidine used in Inferior MI because the patient usually has bradycardia and hypotension and meperidine has antimuscarinic activity</li>
      <li>Used as analgesic in labor because it doesn’t prolong labor (little to no spasmogenic action) BUT its use decrease due to serotonin syndrome</li>
      <li>Preferred in treating the pain associated with diverticulitis, because it decreases intestinal intraluminal pressure</li>
      <li>Preferred in management of shivering during therapeutic hypothermia</li>
      <li>Pethidine possess no advantageous effect on biliary spasm or renal colic in comparison with other opioids</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <hr />
  <section>
    <h2>Adverse effects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
      <li>Urinary retention</li>
      <li>Constipation</li>
      <li>Less sedation compared to other opioids</li>
      <li>It doesn’t cause miosis because of anticholinergic properties</li>
      <li>Respiratory depression</li>
      <li>Bronchoconstriction due to histamine release</li>
      <li>Psychosis</li>
      <li>It has weak atropine like action which lead to dry mouth, tachycardia</li>
      <li>Tolerance</li>
      <li>Physical dependence</li>
      <li>Addiction</li>
      <li>Serotonin syndrome: Pethidine risk of serotonin syndrome increase if used with SSRI or any other serotonergic drugs</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <hr />
  <section>
    <h2>Serotonin syndrome</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is a set of symptoms that occur with use of pethidine and other serotonergic drugs due to increase serotonin level in CNS</li>
      <li>Symptoms include high BP, tachycardia, fever, agitation, hyperreflexia, tremor, sweating, mydriasis and diarrhea</li>
      <li>Those symptoms range from mild to severe</li>
      <li>Complications include seizures and rhabdomyolysis</li>
    </ul>
