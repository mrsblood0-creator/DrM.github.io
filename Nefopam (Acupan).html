      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>After absorption it is bound by 70% to plasma proteins are the rest is distributed to the tissues, especially brain where it exert its effects</li>
        <li>Metabolized by the liver and excreted through urine and bile</li>
        <li>Elimination half life is 3 to 8 hours</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Nefopam act on the brain to relive pain through inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, it also reduce glutamate signaling</li>
        <li>It has no antipyretic or anti inflammatory activity</li>
      </ul>
