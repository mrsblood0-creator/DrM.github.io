    <!-- Key Definitions -->
    <section>
      <h2>Key Definitions</h2>
      <p>Before delving into the course content, itâ€™s essential to grasp some fundamental definitions:</p>
      <ul class="definition-list">
        <li><strong>Orthopedic Trauma:</strong> Injuries involving bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons resulting from falls, motor vehicle accidents, and sports-related injuries. It includes both medical and surgical management.</li>
        <li><strong>Fracture:</strong> A break or crack in the continuity of the bone, leading to pain, swelling, deformity, instability, altered sensation, and loss of function.</li>
        <li><strong>Ligament:</strong> Connects a bone with another bone. <br><strong>Tendon:</strong> Connects muscles to bones.</li>
        <li><strong>Dislocation:</strong> Occurs when a bone is displaced from its normal position within a joint due to ligament injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Subluxation:</strong> Partial dislocation of a bone within its joint.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprain:</strong> Injury to a ligament.</li>
        <li><strong>Strain:</strong> Injury to a tendon or muscle.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Bone Types -->
    <section>
      <h2>Bone Types</h2>
      <p>Before going into the course, it is also important to understand the bone types:</p>
      <ul class="definition-list">
        <li><strong>Cortical Bone:</strong> Also known as compact bone. Dense and strong, found in the outer layer of long bone shafts and flat bones (skull, ribs, pelvis). It makes up 80% of the adult skeleton and heals more slowly than cancellous bone.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellous Bone:</strong> Also called trabecular or spongy bone. Weaker, found at the ends of long bones, vertebral bodies, and inner layers of skull/ribs/pelvis. It makes up 20% of the adult skeleton and heals faster than cortical bone.</li>
      </ul>
