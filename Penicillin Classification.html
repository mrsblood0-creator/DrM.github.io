  <section>
    <p>We have four types of penicillin</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First is benzyl penicillin (penicillin G)</li>
      <li>Second is antistaph penicillin (beta lactam resistant penicillin)</li>
      <li>Extended spectrum penicillin (aminopenicillins)</li>
      <li>Antipseudomonal penicillin</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Benzyl penicillin (penicillin G)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is the original penicillin that discovered by Fleming</li>
      <li>First used in 1942</li>
      <li>It effective against gram positives like streptococci (upper respiratory tract infections), pneumococci (pneumonia), staphylococci that doesnâ€™t produce penicillinase</li>
      <li>It is active against gonococci (cause gonorrhea) which is gram negative; treponema pallidum (cause syphilis), clostridium perfringens (cause gas gangrene)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Not given orally , only IV form</li>
      <li>Half life from 2-4 hours (short half life) so if someone have pneumonia they would take 10 injections per day</li>
      <li>Dissolve by beta lactamse enzyme</li>
      <li>Spectrum narrow</li>
      <li>The only penicillin that is calculated by units because it is natural material because every natural material calculated by units but if we change in it then calculated by mg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Modifications to Penicillin G</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If adding procaine to penicillin it extends it half life to 12-24 hours and it is called procaine penicillin</li>
      <li>Benzathine if added penicillin stay in body 3-4 weeks and it is called benzathine benzyl penicillin or benzathine penicillin G (long acting penicillin) and this is given to kids with recurrent tonsillitis and might have rheumatic fever so give them long acting penicillin and it is taken IM only 1.2-2.4 million units; it is used in prophylaxis and used in treating syphilis in pregnancy</li>
      <li>It also get modified to be taken orally and it is called penicillin V (could be given orally) (phenoxy methyl penicillin)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <hr />
  <section>
    <h2>Anti-staph penicillin (beta lactamase resistant penicillin)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Modification so it become resistant to lactamase; penicillinase resistant penicillin (antistaph penicillin) and include methicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, floxacillin, nafcillin (bile) and those would be active against staph only (narrower spectrum than original form); and it is not used alone because of the spectrum, it is used with other antibiotics to broaden the spectrum like amoxicillin and floxacillin; and even the staph sometimes not affected by it (MRSA)</li>
      <li>Not used anymore because it cause interstitial nephritis</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <hr />
  <section>
    <h2>Amino penicillins (extended spectrum penicillins)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Extension of the spectrum: original penicillin works well with gram + and you want it to work with gram -; gram negative have outer membrane that highly selective; the idea was to make the penicillin look like amino acid to trick the gram negative bacteria and the result was extended spectrum penicillin (amino penicillin) examples are ampicillin and amoxicillin</li>
      <li>Ampicillin and amoxicillin are broad spectrum active against positive and negative bacteria and could be given orally; they are active against penicillin g spectrum and shigella, salmonella (3 advantages); disadvantage include the fact that they are vulnerable to beta lactamase enzyme (staph, Neisseria, pseudomonas, E coli, proteus, H influenza)</li>
      <li>To improve that, they took the ampicillin and amoxicillin and mixed it with clavulanic acid or sulbactam or tazobactam (which are beta lactamase inhibitors) and examples for those include co amoxiclav (co combination amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) also has another name which is amoxicillin, Unasyn (sulbactam + ampicillin)</li>
      <li>Amoxicillin vs ampicillin: both could be given orally but amoxicillin better absorption orally, distribution of amoxicillin is better reaching the respiratory system better, chance of diarrhea as side effect is higher with amp than amox because the absorption is lower so it reaches the intestine more; both have the same spectrum but ampicillin is more active against shigella which cause dysentery, amoxicillin is more active against salmonella (cause typhoid)</li>
      <li>To solve problems of ampicillin. Pro drugs of ampicillin like (talampicillin, Pivampicillin) dissolve in intestine in inactive form and when enter the circulation liver metabolize it into active form</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <hr />
  <section>
    <h2>Anti pseudomonal penicillin</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples: ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin (best one)</li>
      <li>Active against pseudomonas, also active against multiple gram negatives and some gram positives and some anaerobes</li>
      <li>Available in IV formulations only</li>
      <li>Expensive drugs for highly resistant pseudomonas</li>
      <li>Used for wound sepsis in diabetic patients, diabetic foot</li>
      <li>It becomes even more effective when added to aminoglycosides (NH2) work on gram negative so the mix kills all gram negative bacteria</li>
      <li>Antipseudomonal penicillins are negatively charged while aminoglycosides are positively charged so when mixed in same syringe they deactivate each other and preferred to be given in separate syringes in separate sites</li>
      <li>This group of penicillins also affected by beta lactamase enzyme, also added to clavulanic acid or tazobactam or salbactam and tazobactam + piperacillin available as tazocyn</li>
    </ul>
