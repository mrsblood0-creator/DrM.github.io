      <h2>Agonist and Antagonist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When drug combines with a drug target (receptor, ion channel, enzyme, carrier molecule) this may lead to one of the following:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Agonist effect: the drug binds and causes the same action as the normal substance that bind to receptor</li>
          <li>Antagonist effect: the drug binds and stops the action or effect of another substance</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The interaction between the drug and its target can be described by a curve because the drugs affects natural regulatory processes so their effect follows a natural curve</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Terms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Affinity: the probability of drug occupying certain receptor at a given concentration , the higher the affinity the higher the binding to receptor</li>
        <li>Occupancy: measures the extent to which drug occupying the receptors</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Quantal and Graded responses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Graded and quantal responses are associated with the agonist drugs</li>
        <li>Graded response:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>the response is increased proportionally to the dose of the agonist</li>
          <li>example the response of the heart to adrenaline</li>
          <li>It is the response to most drugs</li>
          <li>The response could be tested in one animals or one human in RCT</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Quantal response:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>it is all or none response</li>
          <li>Example is prevention of convulsions by antiepileptic drugs</li>
          <li>It is response to few drugs</li>
          <li>The response could not be tested in one animal and must be tested in a group of animals or humans by randomized clinical trials</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Efficacy vs Potency</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Efficacy refers to the effect of a drug. The more effect the drug does, the higher the efficacy of the drug</li>
        <li>E max is maximal effect that a drug can elicit at specific concentration</li>
        <li>Full agonist occupy all receptors at certain dose and it activates all of them leading to maximal response</li>
        <li>Partial agonist occupy all receptors but it doesn’t activate all of them so we get less than the maximal effect</li>
        <li>ED50 (dose that achieve 50% of effect) dose that gives 50% of E max in graded response or it is the dose that gives the desired effect in 50% of tested population in quantal response</li>
        <li>EC50 same as ED50 (concentration that achieve 50% effect)</li>
        <li>Drug that has smaller ED50 than another drug is described as more potent than the another drug</li>
        <li>Potency of a drug is less clinically important than efficacy because you can increase the dose of a less potent drug that has better effect and we get the better effect than potent drug with less effect</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Therapeutic Index</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Therapeutic index: it is ratio between the TD50 and the ED50</li>
        <li>TD50: dose that achieve toxicity (harmful effect) in 50% of population</li>
        <li>Example: if toxic dose is 10 times the therapeutic dose, therapeutic index is 10</li>
        <li>TI is a measure of safety of drugs</li>
        <li>High therapeutic index means there is large difference between the dose of a drug that produces the desired effect and the dose that produces toxic effect and vice versa for small TI</li>
        <li>Drugs with high TI are more safe for clinical use and vice versa (warfarin has a narrow TI and requires careful therapeutic monitoring)</li>
        <li>Some drugs are toxic drugs in any dose like the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs</li>
      </ul>
