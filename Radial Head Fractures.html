      <h1>Radial Head Fractures: Anatomy, Classification, Clinical Features, Treatment and Complication</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>Radial head and neck fractures are the most common fractures of the elbow joint</p>
      <p>These fractures could be isolated or could be associated with elbow instability, a mechanical block to elbow motion, an injury to distal radioulnar joint and injury to the interosseous membrane</p>
      <p>Diagnosed clinically and by plain radiographs and treated non operatively or operatively depending on many factors</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mechanism of injury</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fall on the elbow or a fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow extended and forearm pronated</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Anatomy of proximal radius</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Radius is the lateral and shorter forearm bone</li>
        <li>Proximal end of the radius composed of a short head, neck and medially directed tuberosity</li>
        <li>Radial head articulate with the capitulum of the humerus proximally to form radiocapitellar joint and with the radial notch of the ulna medially to form proximal radioulnar joint</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Radial tuberosity is where the biceps tendon insert</li>
        <li>The shaft of the radius gradually become bigger and bigger as it passes distally (opposite to ulna)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Classification</h2>
      <p>Mason classification (modified by Hotchkiss and Broberg-Morrey) on four types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Type I</li>
        <li>Type II</li>
        <li>Type III</li>
        <li>Type IV</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Type I</h3>
      <p>non displaced or minimally displaced &lt; 2mm, no mechanical block to pronation and supination</p>
      <h3>Type II</h3>
      <p>Displaced &gt; 2mm or angulated, possible mechanical block to pronation and supination</p>
      <h3>Type III</h3>
      <p>comminuted and displaced fractures, there is mechanical block to pronation and supination</p>

      <p><em>Mason Type III injury; DrJanaOfficial, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>
      <h3>Type IV</h3>
      <p>any radial head fracture + elbow dislocation</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Clinical features</h2>
      <h3>Symptoms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Patient present with elbow pain</li>
        <li>they also complain that they can’t rotate their forearm</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Physical examination</h3>
      <h4>Look</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Elbow swelling</li>
        <li>Ecchymosis</li>
        <li>Deformity if there is associated elbow dislocation</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Feel</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>there is tenderness on pressure over the radial head</li>
        <li>Pain at the distal radioulnar joint is suggestive of an Essex-Lopresti fracture dislocation (explained later) so make sure to palpate the distal radioulnar joint</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Move</h4>
      <p>Assessment of the range of movement at the elbow is important to check for mechanical block and that is done using the local anesthesia test and assessing flexion/extension and pronation/supination</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Imaging</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>AP and lateral elbow X rays: there maybe a clear abnormality or sometimes both views are normal in occult undisplaced fractures</li>
        <li>CT or MRI can help better understand the injury and plan the operative management</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Associated injuries</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lateral (80%) and medial collateral ligaments injuries</li>
        <li>Other fractures: coronoid, olecranon and carpal fractures</li>
        <li>Essex-Lopresti injury (interosseous membrane)</li>
        <li>Monteggia fracture dislocation</li>
        <li>Terrible triad injury</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Essex-Lopresti injury</h2>
      <p>The combination of a radial head fracture, an injury to the distal radio-ulnar joint and interosseous membrane injury</p>
      <p>Can result in progressive forearm displacement and usually requires surgical treatment</p>
      <p>Radial head excision can’t be done if this injury is present, because it would result in secondary wrist problems</p>
    </section>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>Monteggia fracture dislocation</h2>
      <p>The combination of a radial head dislocation (with or without radial head fracture) and proximal ulnar fracture</p>
      <p>Radial excision can’t be done if this injury is present, because it would result in elbow instability</p>
    </section>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>Terrible triad injury</h2>
      <p>Combination of a radial head fracture with ulnar cornoid process fracture and an elbow dislocation</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <h3>Non operative</h3>
      <p>Indications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most of the isolated fractures</li>
        <li>Mason type I fractures</li>
        <li>Mason type II fractures that are not associated with block to forearm rotation (pronation/ supination)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fracture immobilized by sling for 1 week, re assessment by X rays to make sure no further displacement occurred</p>
      <p>Exercises started as soon as possible and Patients are advised to move the arm freely within the limits of comfort to prevent stiffness</p>
      <p>There is loss of the last 5-10 degrees of elbow extension in most cases</p>
      <p>Prognosis is good in 90% of patients</p>

      <h3>Operative</h3>
      <p>Indications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mason type II fractures with mechanical block to forearm rotation</li>
        <li>Mason type III fractures</li>
        <li>Persistent radiocapitellar crepitus or pain</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Operative options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ORIF</li>
        <li>Fragment excision</li>
        <li>Prosthetic replacement</li>
        <li>Radial head excision: for older patients with low demand</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fractures with two substantial head fragments are best fixated, while more comminuted fractures are treated with either prosthetic replacement of radial head excision</p>
      <p>Fragment excision is indicated when there is joint obstruction with a small fragment that is too small to be fixated</p>
      <p>In presence of other injuries (Monteggia, Essex-Lopresti) or where there is suspicion of elbow instability then radial head excision is contraindicated and ORIF or prosthetic replacement has to be done</p>
      <p>Elbow instability is suspected when there is Loss of the cortical contact of the radial head fragment or a fragment that is greater than a quarter of the radial head surface =&gt; should be reduced and fixated</p>
      <p>In all operative cases associated with lateral ligament avulsion, this injury should be treated with suture anchor repair back to the humerus</p>

      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Elbow stiffness</li>
        <li>Loss of elbow range of motion, mostly the last 5-10 degrees of extension occur in most cases</li>
        <li>Stiffness is caused by capsular contractures and ossification and the hardware used in fixation</li>
        <li>Post traumatic arthritis</li>
        <li>This complication occurs due to some incongruity that remained between the joint surfaces</li>
        <li>Late complication</li>
        <li>Patient complain of pain and restriction of movement</li>
        <li>Treated with radial head excision</li>
        <li>Malunion and non union</li>
        <li>Elbow instability</li>
        <li>Surgical site infection</li>
        <li>Secondary displacement</li>
        <li>Posterior interosseous nerve injury secondary to the operation</li>
      </ul>
