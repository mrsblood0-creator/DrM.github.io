    <section>
      <p>Monteggia fracture dislocation is any fracture of the ulna associated with a radial head dislocation</p>
      <p>Monteggia occur more commonly in children and rarely in adults</p>
      <p>Diagnosed by forearm X-rays and treated either operatively or non operatively</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mechanism of injury</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Monteggia result from a fall on the outstretched hand with twisting force or a force that lead to hyperextension of the elbow joint</li>
        <li>It also can occur from direct blow to the forearm and from high energy injuries</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Classification</h2>
      <p>Classified according to Bado classification</p>
      <p>Bado classifies Monteggia fractures according to the direction of the radial head dislocation and the direction of the angulation of the ulna fracture into four types, those include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Type I</li>
        <li>Type II</li>
        <li>Type III</li>
        <li>Type IV</li>
      </ul>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Bado Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Type I</td>
            <td>Anterior dislocation of the radial head + angulated ulna fracture with the apex pointing anteriorly (most common type 60%)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Type II</td>
            <td>Posterior dislocation of the radial head + angulated ulna fracture with the apex pointing posteriorly (worst prognosis)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Type III</td>
            <td>Lateral dislocation of the radial head + ulnar fracture</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Type IV</td>
            <td>dislocation of the radial head in any direction + fractures of both the radius and ulna</td>
          </tr>

      <h2>Clinical features</h2>
      <h3>Symptoms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Patient present with pain in the forearm and elbow</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Physical examination</h3>
      <h4>Look</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Look for Swelling</li>
        <li>Deformity of the ulna is obvious, but the elbow deformity is masked by swelling</li>
        <li>Inspect the lacerations for any evidence of open fracture</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Feel</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Feel for tenderness (esp. on the lateral side of the forearm)</li>
        <li>Neurovascular examination is done to look for nerve/vessel injury (esp. radial nerve)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Move</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Patient refuse movement due to pain</li>
        <li>Examination is repeated multiple times to exclude compartment syndrome</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Imaging</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain radiographs (AP and lateral) are enough for diagnosis</li>
        <li>The radiograph should include the elbow and wrist to detect any injuries to the proximal or distal radioulnar joints</li>
        <li>Radial head is dislocated and does not point to the capitulum anymore (because normally the radius points to the capitulum in all elbow X ray views)</li>
        <li>Ulnar fracture might by incomplete (greenstick) in children and the radial head is not completely ossified so it can be easily missed on X-rays</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Emergency management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Grossly displaced fracture should be reduced in the emergency department</li>
        <li>Above elbow backslab is applied to support the fracture and prevent forearm rotation</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Non operative</li>
        <li>Operative</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Non operative</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Non operative treatment is done in children for the incomplete fractures only (greenstick fractures)</li>
        <li>reduction is achieved by restoring the ulna to its normal length by traction</li>
        <li>Then the forearm is immobilized in above elbow cast for 3 weeks and Re examination is done and radiographs are repeated</li>
        <li>Exercises are started as soon as possible</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Operative</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Operative treatment is done when ulnar fracture is a complete fractures</li>
        <li>Operative treatment is achieved with closed reduction of the radial head and ORIF and plating of the ulnar fracture</li>
        <li>Radial head is reduced by closed reduction, if it remains stable throughout full range of motion of the elbow then no further management needed; but if it re dislocates or it canâ€™t be reduced then it has to be explored and repaired</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <h3>Early Complications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nerve injury: mostly iatrogenic happen during reduction or during surgery, and they are mostly neuropraxias that will recover on their own</li>
        <li>Vascular injury</li>
        <li>Compartment syndrome</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Late Complications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Malunion: occur when the ulna is not perfectly reduced which lead to the radial head remains dislocated and limits elbow flexion</li>
        <li>Non union: treated by plating and bone grafting</li>
        <li>Elbow stiffness: occur especially when the radial head dislocation is missed and when the elbow is immobilized for a longer period of time</li>
      </ul>
