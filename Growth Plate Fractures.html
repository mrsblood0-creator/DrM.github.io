      <h1>Growth Plate Fractures Explained with X-Ray Examples</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>Growth plate fractures are Fractures affecting the growing part of the bone (physis) in children</p>
      <p>15-30% of fractures in children involve injury to the growth plate</p>
      <p>The growth plate (physis) is relatively weak, that is why it fractures commonly in children</p>
      <p>If the fracture injures the reproductive layers of the growth plate, it may result in premature ossification and growth arrest</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Classification</h2>
      <p>Growth plate fractures are classified according to Salter-Harris classification</p>
      <p>This classification is based on the fracture location in relation to the physis, metaphysis and epiphysis, fracture pattern, and prognosis</p>
      <p>It’s on five grades</p>

      <h3>Salter 1</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transverse fracture through the hypertrophic or calcified zone of the plate</li>
        <li>Growth plate state: not injured</li>
        <li>Good prognosis</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Salter 2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transverse fracture through the growth plate and it deviates away from the physis to split off a triangular metaphyseal fragment of bone</li>
        <li>Growth plate state: not injured</li>
        <li>Most common grade</li>
        <li>Good prognosis</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Salter 3</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transverse fracture through the physis and then deviates to the epiphysis</li>
        <li>Growth plate state: injured</li>
        <li>Intra articular</li>
        <li>Poor prognosis</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Salter 4</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fracture location: fracture travels through the epiphysis, physis and metaphysis and it is liable to displacement which if happened result in asymmetrical growth</li>
        <li>Growth plate state: injured</li>
        <li>Intra articular</li>
        <li>Poor prognosis</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Salter 5</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fracture location: longitudinal compression injury of the physis</li>
        <li>Growth plate state: compression injury</li>
        <li>Worst prognosis</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mechanism of injury</h2>
      <p>Growth plate fractures are caused by many types of injuries including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Falls</li>
        <li>Road traffic accidents</li>
        <li>Sporting activities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the hip, slipped upper femoral epiphysis is Salter 1 fracture that can occur without traumatic event</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Clinical features</h2>
      <p>Patient present with pain, tenderness and swelling after traumatic event (mostly fall)</p>
      <p>If the injury involves a lower extremity, the patient is unable to bear weight on the affected side</p>
      <p>Deformity is rare</p>
      <p>Examination is difficult</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>X ray imaging</h2>
      <p>It is hard to tell if there is a fracture or not on x ray because</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The physis (growth plate) is radiolucent</li>
        <li>epiphysis is incompletely ossified</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The younger the child, the larger the radiolucent part on x ray thus the harder to look for fractures</p>
      <p>The easiest way is to x ray the contralateral joint and compare them</p>
      <p>There is usually widening of the physeal gap, incongruity of the joint , tilting of the epiphysis</p>
      <p>if there is displacement then it is easier to diagnose</p>
      <p>Salter 5 are quite hard to diagnose</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>Salter 1 and 2 treated with closed reduction and then casting or splinting, the reduction is through gentle manipulation to avoid injuring the physis</p>
      <p>Salter 3 and 4 treated with open reduction and internal fixation with avoiding crossing the physis</p>
      <p>Reexamination with X ray in seven to ten days is necessary to check for late displacement and additional X ray done in 6- 12 months to assess for growth arrest</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <p>Bone growth arrest</p>
      <p>Grade 1 and 2 Salter Harris have good prognosis (bone growth not affected) if reduced properly except injuries around knee joint involving distal femoral physis or proximal tibial physis, because growth plates there doesn’t have linear shape, so linear fracture would pass through the hypertrophic layer of the growth plate thus affecting growth</p>
      <p>Grade 3 and 4 may result in premature fusion of parts of the growth plate and lead to asymmetrical growth</p>
      <p>Grade 5 fractures always cause premature fusion of parts of the growth plate and lead to asymmetrical growth</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Malunion</li>
        <li>Non union</li>
        <li>Deformity</li>
      </ul>
