    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Famous trade name is Buspar.</li>
        <li>Buspirone is a selective anxiolytic drug that is mainly used in treatment of anxiety disorders.</li>
        <li>Buspirone is included in azapirone drug class; azapirones are a collection of anxiolytics, antidepressants, and antipsychotic drugs.</li>
        <li>It has a different mechanism of action and a lower side effects profile than the other anxiolytics (e.g. benzodiazepines).</li>
        <li>It was synthesized in 1968.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="pharmacokinetics">
      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Buspirone is available as oral formulas only.</li>
        <li>Absorption is rapid but bioavailability is only 4% due to extensive first pass metabolism; bioavailability gets better if buspirone is taken with food.</li>
        <li>Distribution: buspirone is highly protein bound by 86% and distributes to most body tissues including CNS where it has its action.</li>
        <li>Metabolized primarily by oxidation by CYP3A4 and one of its metabolites is active; buspirone getting metabolized by CYP means it is liable to be affected by other drugs that induce or inhibit CYP enzymes.</li>
        <li>Excretion through urine by 60% and bile by 40%; elimination half life is around 3 hours.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanism">
      <h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Not related to GABA unlike the other anxiolytics like benzodiazepines.</li>
        <li>Buspirone works as a partial agonist on serotonin receptors 5HT1a and 5HT2; it also works as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 receptors.</li>
        <li>Activating serotonin receptors leads to increased serotonergic activity in the amygdala and other parts of the brain &rarr; relief of anxiety.</li>
        <li>Weak antagonism of Dopamine D2 receptors leads to attenuation of the side effects of Parkinson’s disease therapy.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="pharmacologic-effects">
      <h2>Pharmacologic Effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Selective anxiolytic.</li>
        <li>It doesn’t lead to sedative, hypnotic or euphoric effects unlike benzodiazepines.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="fda-uses">
      <h2>FDA Approved Therapeutic Uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is used in treatment of anxiety disorders.</li>
        <li>Buspirone is used as a second line in treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (after SSRI which are the first line).</li>
        <li>There is no risk for dependence or tolerance with buspirone, that makes it better than benzodiazepines and barbiturates for treatment of anxiety.</li>
        <li>The anxiolytic effects of buspirone may take 3-4 weeks to reach full clinical effect, making the drug unsuitable for management of acute anxiety.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="off-label-uses">
      <h2>Off Label Therapeutic Uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Buspirone is used for treatment of depression.</li>
        <li>In treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="adverse-effects">
      <h2>Adverse Effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CNS: abnormal dreams, ataxia, confusion, drowsiness, headache, paresthesia, akathisia (rare).</li>
        <li>Blurred vision.</li>
        <li>Tinnitus.</li>
        <li>Chest pain.</li>
        <li>Nausea, diarrhea.</li>
        <li>Pain and weakness.</li>
        <li>It may lead to elevated liver enzymes.</li>
        <li>There is no liability for tolerance or drug dependence with buspirone.</li>
        <li>Serotonin syndrome is a possible adverse effect because buspirone increases serotonin levels, and serotonin syndrome is much more possible if buspirone is combined with other medications that increase serotonin in the brain (e.g. MAOI).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="serotonin-syndrome">
      <h2>Serotonin Syndrome</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Is a set of symptoms that occur with use of buspirone and other serotonergic drugs due to increased serotonin level in CNS.</li>
        <li>Symptoms include high BP, tachycardia, fever, agitation, hyperreflexia, tremor, sweating, mydriasis and diarrhea.</li>
        <li>Those symptoms range from mild to severe.</li>
        <li>Complications include seizures and rhabdomyolysis.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="contraindications">
      <h2>Contraindications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>History of hypersensitivity reactions to buspirone.</li>
        <li>Avoid combining with MAOI or other drugs that inhibit MAO (e.g. linezolid) because of risk of serotonin syndrome.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="toxicity">
      <h2>Toxicity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Buspirone overdose is rare.</li>
        <li>Patient presents with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, miosis and gastric distress.</li>
        <li>Symptomatic management.</li>
      </ul>
