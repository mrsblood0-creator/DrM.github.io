    </header>

    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid, working as a mixed agonist/antagonist (partial agonist).</li>
        <li>Synthesized in the late 1960s, it is a derivative of thebaine.</li>
        <li>Famous for its use in the treatment of pain and opioid misuse disorder.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="pharmacokinetics">
      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Available in sublingual, buccal, transdermal, IV, and IM formulations.</li>
        <li>Oral formula is not used due to significant first pass effect.</li>
        <li>Bioavailability: sublingual 30%, buccal 65%.</li>
        <li>Metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4 and CYP2C8).</li>
        <li>Onset of action: 30 minutes after administration.</li>
        <li>Elimination half-life: ~37 hours; duration of action: ~20 hours.</li>
        <li>Excreted through kidney and liver.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanism">
      <h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Acts as a potent partial agonist at mu opioid receptor and antagonist at kappa and delta receptors (mixed agonist antagonist).</li>
        <li>Compared to morphine for equivalent dose, buprenorphine sublingual is ~50 times more potent, and 100 times more potent as a transdermal patch.</li>
        <li>Can displace full mu agonists (e.g., morphine) due to higher potency, leading to withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent patients.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="pharmacologic-effect">
      <h2>Pharmacologic Effect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides analgesia for moderate to severe pain, but can antagonize the analgesic effects of agonist opioids if used concurrently.</li>
        <li>Less euphoric effects, thus lower abuse potential than agonist opioids.</li>
        <li>Lower risk of respiratory depression compared to agonist opioids.</li>
        <li>Slow dissociation from receptors leads to long duration of action and mild withdrawal symptoms when stopped.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="therapeutic-uses">
      <h2>Therapeutic Uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Treatment of chronic pain (as transdermal patch), with long duration (~24 hours).</li>
        <li>Treatment of opioid addiction (like methadone) due to long duration, less withdrawal symptoms, and blocking effects of agonist opioids during effect period.</li>
        <li>Shorter and less severe withdrawal symptoms compared to methadone.</li>
        <li>For opioid misuse disorder, used in combination with naloxone sublingually or buccally; IV use is avoided to prevent abuse (naloxone would cause acute withdrawal if injected).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="adverse-effects">
      <h2>Adverse Effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not cause respiratory depression unless at very high dose, but if it occurs, it cannot be reversed by naloxone.</li>
        <li>Risk of respiratory depression is higher if injected IV with benzodiazepines.</li>
        <li>Increased blood pressure due to increased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance.</li>
        <li>Prolongation of QT interval (risky in cardiovascular diseases).</li>
        <li>Psychotomimetic effects: hallucinations, nightmares, anxiety (reported with mixed agonist-antagonist drugs).</li>
        <li>Low addiction risk due to less mu activation.</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting.</li>
        <li>Constipation.</li>
        <li>Headache, mild amnesia, cognitive and neural inhibition.</li>
        <li>Pruritus.</li>
        <li>Risk of seizures in epilepsy patients.</li>
        <li>Miosis.</li>
        <li>Urinary retention.</li>
      </ul>
