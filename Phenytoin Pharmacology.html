      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Aka Diphenyl Hydantoin, famous trade name: Dilantin</li>
        <li>It is a first generation antiepileptic Drug that is used in management of seizures and epilepsy</li>
        <li>Most famous and the oldest nonsedating antiepileptic drug</li>
        <li>Phenytoin first synthesized by German chemist Heinrich Biltz in 1908</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Phenytoin is available is oral formula and IV formula, “phenytoin” is not given intravenously because it may lead to purple glove syndrome which purple discoloration accompanied by pain and edema distal to the site of injection</li>
        <li>Fos phenytoin is a pro drug to phenytoin that can be given IV with less risk for purple glove syndrome because it is more water soluble</li>
        <li>Absorption of the oral formulas is complete</li>
        <li>Distribution: phenytoin is highly bound to plasma proteins by 90% and prone to displacement by other drugs that compete for the binding to the plasma proteins (e.g. valproic acid, and warfarin), and by pathologies where there is low serum albumin => displacement lead to toxicity</li>
        <li>Phenytoin is metabolized by CYP2C9 & CYP2C19 to inactive metabolite excreted in urine, at therapeutic doses it follows zero order kinetics because the liver reach the maximum capacity to metabolize the drug</li>
        <li>Therapeutic window is between 10 and 20 mcg/ml (narrow) and Half life is around 24 hours</li>
        <li>Phenytoin is CYP inducer, and decrease the blood levels of many other antiepileptic drugs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Blocks voltage gated Na+ channels in the brain and heart</li>
        <li>It is classified as antiarrhythmic drug class 1</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>Therapeutic uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Used in prevention of focal onset seizures, generalized onset Tonic clonic seizures and in treatment of status epilepticus</li>
        <li>Phenytoin may worsen other types of seizure like absence seizures, juvenile myoclonic seizures and Dravet’s epilepsy</li>
        <li>Previously it was used as antiarrhythmic drug and classified as Class I antiarrhythmic drugs</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Adverse effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CNS: nystagmus</li>
        <li>CNS: diplopia</li>
        <li>CNS: ataxia</li>
        <li>Liver: microsomal enzyme induction</li>
        <li>Blood: megaloblastic anemia (due to increase folic acid metabolism)</li>
        <li>Gingival hyperplasia and Hirsutism occur to some degree in most patients</li>
        <li>Lymphadenopathy and hypersensitivity reactions are rare</li>
        <li>With long term use result in Osteomalacia due to abnormalities in vit D metabolism</li>
        <li>With long term use there is coarsening of facial features and mild peripheral neuropathy</li>
        <li>Pregnancy: teratogenic lead to craniofacial anomalies (fetal hydantoin syndrome) and neural tube defects (spina bifida)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <hr />

    <section>
      <h2>Fetal hydantoin syndrome</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Intrauterine growth restriction</li>
        <li>Microcephaly</li>
        <li>Intellectual difficulty</li>
        <li>Hypoplastic nails and distal phalanges</li>
        <li>Heart defects: ASD, VSD, PDA …</li>
        <li>Cleft lip</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Phenytoin toxicity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Early signs of phenytoin reaching therapeutic levels are nystagmus and loss of smoothness of eye movements and neither of those is indication for decreasing dose</li>
        <li>Once therapeutic dose exceeded then diplopia and ataxia develop and those require dose adjustment to be resolved</li>
        <li>With higher doses confusion, lethargy and coma develop</li>
        <li>Rapid infusion of intravenous phenytoin lead to bradycardia, hypotension and asystole, care must be taken to administer IV phenytoin with a rate slower than 50 mg/ minute</li>
      </ul>
