      <h1>Galeazzi Fracture Dislocation: Clinical Features, Treatment and Complications</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>Galeazzi fracture dislocation is a fracture of the middle to distal radius associated with a subluxation or dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint</p>
      <p>Galeazzi fractures are much more common than Monteggia fractures, Galeazzi account for 7% of all forearm fractures in adults</p>
      <p>Radius fractures occurring closer to the wrist are associated with greater instability of the DRUJ</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mechanism of injury</h2>
      <p>Caused by a fall on the outstretched hand with extended wrist and pronated forearm and a rotational force applied to the body</p>
      <p>They also could occur from sports injuries and motor vehicle accidents</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Clinical features</h2>
      <h3>Symptoms</h3>
      <p>Patient present with pain in the forearm and wrist</p>
      <h3>Physical examination</h3>
      <h4>Look</h4>
      <p>Look for Swelling, contusions and lacerations</p>
      <p>Deformity of the radius or wrist might be obvious</p>
      <p>Inspect the lacerations for any evidence of open fracture</p>
      <h4>Feel</h4>
      <p>Feel for tenderness over the forearm and wrist</p>
      <p>Neurovascular examination is done to look for nerve/vessel injury (esp. median and radial nerves), inquire about weakness, numbness, paresthesia and motor examination</p>
      <h4>Move</h4>
      <p>Patient refuse movement due to pain</p>
      <p>Examination is repeated multiple times to exclude compartment syndrome</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Imaging</h2>
      <p>X-ray radiographs (forearm AP and lateral) should be ordered and they are enough for diagnosis</p>
      <p>A transverse or oblique fracture is seen in the radius with angulation or shortening,</p>
      <p>DRUJ is disrupted, signs include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Widening of DRUJ on AP</li>
        <li>Dorsal displacement of the ulna on the lateral view</li>
        <li>Ulnar styloid fracture</li>
        <li>Radial shortening greater than 5 mm</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Note</h2>
      <p>The distal radioulnar joint could be injured with isolated radial fracture at any level, or in both forearm bones fractures</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Emergency management</h2>
      <p>Pain management</p>
      <p>Gross forearm deformity should be reduced in the emergency department under procedural sedation</p>
      <p>Above elbow backslab is applied to support the fracture and prevent rotation</p>
      <p>Reassessment of neurovascular status is done</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Definitive management</h2>
      <p>Same as Monteggia, it is important to restore the length of the broken bone</p>
      <p>In children, closed reduction is often successful, but in adults closed reduction lead to poor outcomes</p>
      <p>That is why in adults, reduction is best achieved by ORIF and plating of the radius and the DRUJ is re examined and re imaged to ensure it is reduced</p>
      <p>If the DRUJ is reduced and stable on full range of movement, no further management is needed</p>
      <p>If the DRUJ is reduced but unstable then the forearm should be immobilized in the position of stability for the DRUJ (usually supination); K wires maybe applied to support the joint</p>
      <p>If the DRUJ is irreducible by closed reduction then open reduction is needed to remove soft tissue interposition or fracture fragment preventing reduction; the triangular fibrocartilage complex and dorsal capsule are then carefully repaired, if there is associated ulnar styloid fracture then it has to be repaired by ORIF</p>
      <p>After reduction in all cases, above elbow casting in supination is done for 6 weeks , exercises started as soon as possible</p>

      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <h3>Early</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Vascular injury</li>
        <li>Nerve injury</li>
        <li>Compartment syndrome: especially in high energy injuries</li>
        <li>Muscle tendon entrapment: make reduction difficult</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Late</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Malunion</li>
        <li>Non union</li>
        <li>Radioulnar synostosis</li>
        <li>Elbow stiffness</li>
      </ul>
