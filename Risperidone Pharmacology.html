    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Famous trade name is Risperdal</li>
      <li>It is atypical antipsychotic medication (new, second generation)</li>
      <li>It is used in treatment of schizophrenia and some other mental disorders and it is better tolerated than typical antipsychotics because of fewer side effects</li>
      <li>Risperidone synthesized in 1980 in Belgium</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Risperidone is available as oral, IM, and IV formulas, there is long acting injectables with duration of action of 2-4 weeks</li>
      <li>Long acting formulas provide improved compliance and reduced relapse rates compared to oral formulas</li>
      <li>Oral formula of the risperidone has good absorption with bioavailability of 70%</li>
      <li>It is metabolized by the liver by CYP enzymes especially CYP2D6</li>
      <li>Excreted mainly through urine and it also excreted through feces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Risperidone antagonizes serotonin 5HT receptors and dopamine D2 receptors</li>
      <li>BUT it has more serotonin antagonism than dopamine antagonism and that what it make different from typical antipsychotics</li>
      <li>Serotonin antagonism makes risperidone good in managing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, like social isolation, poverty of speech, lack of motivation and inability to feel pleasure</li>
      <li>Antagonism of serotonin by this medication also lead to relief of some of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur as a result of dopamine antagonism</li>
      <li>BUT serotonin antagonism lead to weight gain and metabolic changes as adverse effects with the use of this medication</li>
      <li>Risperidone work by antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors in the brain</li>
      <li>It blocks dopamine in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway which lead to relieving of the psychosis</li>
      <li>It also blocks dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway which lead to extrapyramidal symptoms as adverse effects</li>
      <li>It also blocks dopamine in the tuberoinfundibular pathway lead to hyperprolactinemia as an adverse effect</li>
      <li>It has anti histamine activity which lead to drowsiness</li>
      <li>It blocks alpha adrenergic receptors to some degree too</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FDA Approved Therapeutic Uses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Schizophrenia (in adults and children aged 13 and older): risperidone is more effective in treating schizophrenia than all typical antipsychotics except for haloperidol</li>
      <li>Acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder: as monotherapy for adults and children aged 10 and older</li>
      <li>Acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder: as adjunctive with lithium or valproate</li>
      <li>Autism in children aged 5 and older: risperidone controls problematic behaviors, aggression, self injury and rapid mood changes</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Non FDA Approved Therapeutic Uses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dementia: they produce slight benefits in dementia patients, but there is increase risk of death (because it increase risk of stroke)</li>
      <li>Psychotic polydipsia</li>
      <li>PTSD, delirium, depression, borderline personality, conduct disorder and Tourette disorder</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Dosing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For schizophrenia: start with 1 mg daily then increase the dose by 0.5 mg every six to seven days to target 2 mg daily, doses exceeding 4 mg per day are rarely more effective, max dose is 16 mg per day; for elderly same dose except you increase by 0.25 mg every six to seven days instead of 0.5 mg</li>
      <li>For acute manic episodes of bipolar disorder: 2 to 3 mg daily dose, max dose is 6 mg per day</li>
      <li>Daily dose in both disorders can be taken at once or divided into two doses</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adverse Effects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Weight gain, high blood sugar levels and metabolic problems</li>
      <li>Sedation</li>
      <li>Hyperprolactinemia lead to sexual dysfunction</li>
      <li>Increase risk of seizures in seizure disorders patients</li>
      <li>Extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders): risperidone produce more extrapyramidal symptoms than other atypical antipsychotics does</li>
      <li>Acute dystonia: muscle spasm develops within hours to days after initiation</li>
      <li>Akathisia: restlessness develops days to months after initiation</li>
      <li>Tardive dyskinesia: uncontrollable repetitive movements develops after years of initiation</li>
      <li>Muscle rigidity</li>
      <li>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</li>
      <li>Muscle rigidity</li>
      <li>Hyperthermia</li>
      <li>Autonomic disturbance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
