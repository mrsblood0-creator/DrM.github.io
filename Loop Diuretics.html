    <section>
      <h2>Types</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We have four loop diuretics: furosemide (Lasix), bumetanide, torsemide, ethacrynic acid</li>
        <li>Bumetanide and torsemide are more potent than furosemide</li>
        <li>Ethacrynic acid has a lot of adverse effects</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Furosemide absorption by 60% while bumetanide absorbed by 100%</li>
        <li>Bumetanide would be more potent than furosemide</li>
        <li>If taken orally diuresis start after 30 minutes while if taken intravenously the diuresis starts after 5 minutes</li>
        <li>After absorption they go into different sites of the body including the kidney where they get secreted through the proximal convoluted tubule and then after that they move until they reach the TAL where their site of action located</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Loop diuretics blocks NaKCl in the TAL of loop of Henle</li>
        <li>Loop diuretics inhibit the cotransport of Na+/K+/2Cl− in the luminal membrane in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, (NaKCl accounts for reabsorption of 25% to 30% of filtered NaCl)</li>
        <li>So we would lose na, water, k/cl, mg/ca, H+</li>
        <li>Loop diuretics enhance prostaglandin E2 and I2 synthesis which lead to renal vasodilation and increase blood flow to kidney Lead to increase GFR</li>
        <li>And also have systemic vasodilatation effect that would lower the blood pressure</li>
        <li>Speaking of GFR, loop diuretics can work even if GFR is 10 ml/min (end stage renal failure) and that ‘s why it is called high ceiling diuretics (very efficient)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Therapeutic uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Acute pulmonary edema</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The loop diuretics are the drugs of choice for reducing acute pulmonary edema and acute/chronic peripheral edema caused from heart failure or renal impairment. Because of their rapid onset of action, particularly when given intravenously, the drugs are useful in emergency situations such as acute pulmonary edema.</li>
          <li>In people who have left side heart failure and the blood is congested in the lung and also in people who have severe hypertension and their after load is very high due to systemic vasoconstriction</li>
          <li>The blood going from right ventricle to lungs and then goes back into left ventricle where it cannot be ejected either because left side of heart is weak or either because of systemic vascular resistance</li>
          <li>This lead to intrapulmonary hydrostatic pressure increase =&gt; lung capillaries would leak water and this lead to cyanosis and difficulty breathing =&gt; acute pulmonary edema</li>
          <li>This treated with furosemide injection that lead to decrease volume =&gt; decrease after load ; increase PGE2 and I2 that lead to vasodiltation and decrease systemic vascular resistance and blood ejecting from the pulmonary veins and also lead vasodiltation in lungs and congestion relief</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Acute or chronic peripheral edema</li>
        <li>Acute or chronic renal failure</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Loop diuretics can work even if GFR is 10 ml/min (very efficient)</li>
          <li>It also increase PGE2/I2 =&gt; vasodiltation =&gt; increase blood flow into kidney =&gt; increase GFR</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Hypertensive emergencies</li>
        <ul>
          <li>When systolic pressure &gt; 180 =&gt; cerebral hemorrhage or encephalopathy</li>
          <li>Loops diuretics decrease blood pressure by</li>
          <li>1- decrease water in the body</li>
          <li>2- increase PGE2 and I2 =&gt; vasodiltation</li>
          <li>3- decrease Na in the body</li>
          <li>Na make blood vessels endothelium more sensitive to catecholamines which lead to vasoconstriction; so by decreasing it this lead to decrease BP</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Hypercalcemia</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Loop diuretics with hydration used for treating hypercalcemia, because they stimulate tubular ca excretion</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Adverse effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Acute hypovolemia: Loop diuretics can cause a severe and rapid reduction in blood volume, with the possibility of hypotension, shock, and cardiac arrhythmias</li>
        <li>Potassium depletion</li>
        <li>Hypomagnesemia</li>
        <li>Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis</li>
        <li>Hyperuricemia</li>
        <li>Disturbed glucose metabolism and hyperlipidemia</li>
        <li>Ototoxicity</li>
        <li>Hypersensitivity</li>
      </ul>
