    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Famous trade names: Clozaril and Leponex</li>
        <li>It is atypical antipsychotic medication (new, second generation) and the first atypical to be discovered</li>
        <li>It is mainly used in treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in resistant cases</li>
        <li>Clozapine was synthesized in 1958 by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Wander AG</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="pharmacokinetics">
      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Available as oral formula only</li>
        <li>It is well absorbed with bioavailability of 60% due to first pass metabolism</li>
        <li>Metabolized extensively by the liver via CYP enzymes, especially CYP1A2 and excreted through urine and feces</li>
        <li>Elimination half life is 14 hours</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanism">
      <h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>clozapine antagonizes serotonin 5HT receptors and dopamine receptors</li>
        <li>Serotonin antagonism makes clozapine good in managing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, like social isolation, poverty of speech, lack of motivation and inability to feel pleasure</li>
        <li>Antagonism of serotonin by this medication also lead to relief of some of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur as a result of dopamine antagonism</li>
        <li>BUT serotonin antagonism lead to weight gain and metabolic changes as adverse effects with the use of this medication</li>
        <li>Clozapine antagonizes dopamine but it has higher affinity to dopamine D4 receptors more than D2 receptors which lead to less extrapyramidal symptoms compared to other antipsychotics</li>
        <li>Dopamine antagonism in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway which lead to relieving of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia</li>
        <li>It also blocks dopamine in the tuberoinfundibular pathway but it has lower risk of hyperprolactinemia compared with other antipsychotics</li>
        <li>It has anti histamine activity which lead to drowsiness</li>
        <li>It also block muscarinic receptors including M1, 2, 3, 5; it is agonist at M4</li>
        <li>It blocks alpha adrenergic receptors to some degree too</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="therapeutic-uses">
      <h2>Therapeutic uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use of clozapine in treatment of schizophrenia has shown better symptoms control and reduced risk of hospitalization and drug discontinuation but it is not used as a first line because it may lead to agranulocytosis and GIT hypomotility which may kill the patient (that will be discussed in the adverse effects part of this article)</li>
        <li>It is used in treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Patients who didn’t have adequate response to two other antipsychotic medications (resistant cases)</li>
          <li>Patients who are unable to tolerate other antipsychotics due to extrapyramidal side effects</li>
          <li>Patients who develop tardive dyskinesia while on some other antipsychotic medication</li>
        </ul>
        <li>It is used in treatment of psychosis that occur as a side effect to Parkinson’s disease treatment</li>
        <li>It is used for reducing risk of suicide in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who has high suicide risk</li>
        <li>Third line in treatment of manic phase of bipolar disorder (lithium being first line, other atypicals being second line)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="dosage">
      <h2>Dosage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>According to FDA, max dose is 900 mg/day, average dose is 300 mg/day for women and 400 mg/day for men</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="adverse-effects">
      <h2>Adverse effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clozapine used as a second line because it may lead to agranulocytosis (agranulocytosis likely to be fatal) in the first year and a half of treatment, after that risk reduces, also because it lead to GIT hypomotility (surprisingly most common cause of death from this medication more than agranulocytosis even)</li>
        <li>clozapine lead to bone marrow suppression and agranulocytosis (1% of cases) which is severe neutropenia less than 500 /mm</li>
        <li>Risk factors for agranulocytosis are old age, female, concurrent tx with medications that cause same condition, monitor with CBC</li>
        <li>It may lead to GIT hypomotility which may lead to severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis</li>
        <li>It may lead to myocarditis (3% of cases) which is inflammation of the heart muscle, also fatal</li>
        <li>Risk factors for myocarditis include rapid titration of the drug, concurrent use of SSRIs, illicit substance abuse</li>
        <li>Most common adverse effect of clozapine is hypersalivation in 60% of the patients, clozapine is agonist in M4 which is highly expressed in salivary glands</li>
        <li>Weight gain, high blood sugar levels due to serotonin antagonism</li>
        <li>It also block alpha adrenergic receptors to some degree leading to postural hypotension and palpitation</li>
        <li>Increased risk of death if used in patient with dementia related psychosis</li>
        <li>Extrapyramidal symptoms are not common with this medication because of its anticholinergic effects and serotonin antagonism and its higher affinity for dopamine D4 more than D2 receptors</li>
        <li>Increase risk of seizures in seizure disorders patients</li>
        <li>Anticholinergic side effects: Elevated temperature, sedation, constipation and urinary retention</li>
        <li>Periorbital edema (rare)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="withdrawal">
      <h2>Clozapine withdrawal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Abrupt withdrawal of clozapine lead to cholinergic rebound effects, those include</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Indigestion</li>
          <li>Diarrhea</li>
          <li>Nausea/vomiting</li>
          <li>Hypersalivation</li>
          <li>Sweating</li>
          <li>Insomnia</li>
          <li>Agitation</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="interactions">
      <h2>Drug interactions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fluvoxamine (SSRI), theophylline, ciprofloxacin all inhibit metabolism of the medication leading to increased blood levels and overdose</li>
        <li>Carbamazepine increase metabolism of this medication leading to low plasma levels and treatment failure and it also increase risk of agranulocytosis</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="overdose">
      <h2>Clozapine overdose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Symptoms of overdose include sedation, confusion, tachycardia, seizures and ataxia</li>
