      <ul>
        <li>Heroin (is a trade name) is also known as diacetylmorphine and diamorphine (acetylated morphine) and it is a Semi synthetic opioid</li>
        <li>Heroin is used medically in several countries to relieve pain (analgesic) but it is banned in most countries because it is highly addictive</li>
        <li>It is used illegally for recreational use due to the euphoria it induces</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>First synthesized in 1874 by Charles Alder Wright an English chemist but the invention didn’t lead to any further developments</li>
        <li>Re synthesized again in 1897 by Felix Hoffmann who is a German chemist, heroin marketed initially as an over the counter drug for cough suppression to replace the addictive morphine</li>
        <li>Soon in 1910 heroin had one of the highest addiction among its users</li>
        <li>In 1924, United States banned heroin</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Administration: oral and IV are the most common formulas</li>
        <li>Absorption: the oral form is very well absorbed which then undergoes extensive first pass effect via deacetylation to be converted to morphine</li>
        <li>Distributed quickly to tissues especially the brain</li>
        <li>Metabolized by liver and excreted through kidney and liver</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>heroin works on the opioid receptors which are three major receptors Mu (μ), delta (δ) and kappa (κ) which are available everywhere in the body , especially in the central nervous system</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pharmacologic effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Heroin produces greater pharmacologic effects than the morphine</li>
        <li>Activation of these opioid receptors lead to several central effects (CNS effects):</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Analgesia</li>
          <li>Euphoria</li>
          <li>Sedation</li>
          <li>Respiratory depression</li>
          <li>Cough suppression</li>
          <li>Miosis</li>
          <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
          <li>Pruritus</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Activation of these opioid receptors lead to several peripheral effects including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>CVS</li>
          <li>GIT</li>
          <li>RS</li>
          <li>Renal</li>
          <li>Endocrine</li>
          <li>Immune</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Adverse effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tolerance</li>
        <li>Physical dependence</li>
        <li>Addiction</li>
      </ul>
