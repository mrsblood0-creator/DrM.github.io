      <h1>Acromioclavicular Joint Injuries: Rockwood Classification, Clinical Features and Treatment</h1>

      <p>Acromioclavicular joint injuries are common in athletes and workers who use heavy equipment and they occur in any age, specially 20-40 years age group, they represent more than 40% of all shoulder injuries.</p>
      <p>Mild injuries are not associated with any significant morbidity while severe injuries are associated with chronic pain and significant loss of shoulder function.</p>

      <h2>Mechanism of injury</h2>
      <p>A fall on the shoulder with arm adducted &rarr; AC ligaments are torn first &rarr; CC ligaments are torn with higher forces leading to complete dislocation of the joint.</p>
      <p>Fall onto an outstretched hand or elbow may also result in AC joint injures.</p>

      <h2>Classification</h2>
      <p>Injury is graded according to the Rockwood classification of AC joint injuries.</p>
      <p>Rockwood classification is a 6 grade system and it is a modification of Allman and Tossy’s 3 grade system, the first and second grades are same in both systems, while grade three in Allman and Tossy classification is subdivided into four grades in Rockwood classification.</p>
      <p>Rockwood classification classify AC joint injures based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acromioclavicular joint alignment</li>
        <li>Coracoclavicular ligament status</li>
        <li>Deltoid and trapezius muscles status (both attach to the lateral part of the clavicle)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Acromioclavicular joint normal anatomy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The inferior edge of the clavicle bone and inferior edge of the acromion should be leveled (on the same line) on clavicle AP view with 20 degree cephalic tilt</li>
        <li>It is okay if the superior edges don’t match up</li>
        <li>The joint space should be uniform and joint distance less than 8 mm (normal 5-8 mm)</li>
        <li>Normal Coracoclavicular distance is between 11-13 mm and there should be no greater than 5 mm difference between right and left</li>
        <li>No soft tissue swelling</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Normal Acromioclavicular joint</em></p>

      <h3>Rockwood Grade I</h3>
      <p>Described as AC joint sprain.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The clavicle is not elevated in respect to acromion (X ray appears normal)</li>
        <li>Acromioclavicular ligament: sprained</li>
        <li>Coracoclavicular ligament: normal</li>
        <li>AC Joint capsule: normal</li>
        <li>Trapezius muscle: attached</li>
        <li>Deltoid muscle: attached</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Rockwood Grade I, Yosi I, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>

      <h3>Rockwood Grade II</h3>
      <p>Described as AC joint subluxation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clavicle elevated but not above superior border of acromion</li>
        <li>Acromioclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Coracoclavicular ligament: sprained</li>
        <li>Joint capsule: torn</li>
        <li>Trapezius muscle: minimal detachment</li>
        <li>Deltoid muscle: minimal detachment</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Rockwood Grade II, Yosi I, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>

      <h3>Rockwood Grade III</h3>
      <p>AC joint dislocation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clavicle elevated above the superior border of acromion, the coracoclavicular distance is less than 25 mm</li>
        <li>Acromioclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Coracoclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Joint capsule: torn and joint is dislocated</li>
        <li>Trapezius muscle: complete detachment</li>
        <li>Deltoid muscle: complete detachment</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Rockwood Grade III, Yosi I, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>

      <h3>Rockwood Grade IV</h3>
      <p>Result from posteriorly directed forces that make the clavicle penetrates the trapezius muscle, sometimes completely.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acromioclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Coracoclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Joint capsule: torn</li>
        <li>Trapezius muscle: complete detachment</li>
        <li>Deltoid muscle: complete detachment</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Rockwood Grade IV, Yosi I, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>

      <h3>Rockwood Grade V</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clavicle is markedly elevated and coracoclavicular distance is more than 25 mm</li>
        <li>Acromioclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Coracoclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Joint capsule: torn</li>
        <li>Trapezius muscle: complete detachment</li>
        <li>Deltoid muscle: complete detachment</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Rockwood Grade V, Yosi I, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>

      <h3>Rockwood Grade VI</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Inferior displacement of clavicle beneath the coracoid process</li>
        <li>Acromioclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Coracoclavicular ligament: torn</li>
        <li>Joint capsule: torn</li>
        <li>Trapezius muscle: detached</li>
        <li>Deltoid muscle: detached</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Rockwood Grade VI, Yosi I, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>

      <h2>Clinical features</h2>
      <p>Patient complain of shoulder pain and swelling; and they can locate where the pain exactly is (AC joint).</p>
      <p>On examination, there is tenderness while palpating the shoulder, if there is no deformity seen then the injury is either Grade I or II, but if there is deformity then it is Grade III, IV, V, VI.</p>
      <p>Shoulder movements are limited due to pain but active abduction to 45 degrees would exclude rotator cuff tear.</p>

      <h2>Imaging</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>AP clavicle with 20 degrees cephalic tilt: this view show inferior edge of the clavicle at the same line as the inferior edge of acromion</li>
        <li>Axillary views: confirm whether there is posterior displacement of the clavicle (Rockwood type IV)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Emergency management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>ATLS trauma protocol</li>
        <li>Closed reduction is not helpful in these injures</li>
        <li>Provide a sling and pain relief</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Definitive management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Grade 1 and 2 (sprains and subluxations) are treated with sling immobilization for around 1 week until pain subsides and patient encouraged to exercise shoulder, elbow and fingers</li>
        <li>Grade 3 (dislocations) is treated non operatively unless there is extreme prominence of the clavicle, or in patients who want to resume their strenuous overarm or overhead activities then treated operatively</li>
        <li>Grade 4, 5, 6 are treated operatively</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Operative treatment include accurate reduction, and fixation of the clavicle with the acromion is done using a hook plate.</p>
      <p>There is also the modified Weaver-Dunn procedure.</p>

      <h3>Modified Weaver-Dunn procedure</h3>
      <p>Modified Weaver-Dunn include excision of the lateral end of the clavicle and coracoacromial ligaments are transferred to the outer end of the clavicle and attached by trans osseous sutures.</p>
      <p>Clavicle is anchored to the coracoid with anchors or slings to reduce the tension on the repair during the healing phase.</p>
      <p>Elbow and forearm exercises begun one day after operation and assisted shoulder exercises are started 2 weeks later, active movements are started 4-6 weeks after and strenuous lifting is avoided for 6 months.</p>

      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supraspinatus tendonitis:</strong> is sometimes associated with AC joint injures and supraspinatus tendinitis may occur directly due to the primary injury or may result from edema or inflammation occurring after the initial injury</li>
        <li><strong>Unreduced dislocation:</strong> affects function, treated with reconstruction of CC ligaments, if failed then Modified Weaver-Dunn procedure is done</li>
        <li><strong>Ossification of ligaments:</strong> especially in severe injures, ossification of ligaments lead to late rotator cuff dysfunction</li>
        <li><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> is a late complication that might occur with these injures</li>
      </ul>
