      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tramadol is a synthetic opioid analgesic medication</li>
        <li>Synthesized in 1963 in Germany and used commercially in 1977 under trade name Tramal</li>
        <li>It is famous for producing less euphoria compared to other opioids, thus it is less addictive</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Available as oral formulas (onset of pain relief after one hour of ingestion), also available as IV, IM and rectal formulas</li>
        <li>Well absorbed with 70% oral bioavailability and 77% rectal</li>
        <li>It undergoes extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 in the liver leading to desmethyltramadol which has more affinity to mu receptors and thus it is more active and lead to most of tramadol analgesic effects, some people has different variations of this enzyme that convert tramadol into inactive metabolites with no analgesic action</li>
        <li>Excreted through the kidney</li>
        <li>Tramadol Elimination half life is about 9 hours</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tramadol Bind to opioid receptors, especially mu receptors but it has low affinity to these receptors, it undergoes extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 leading to active metabolite which has much higher affinity for mu receptors which lead to its analgesic effects</li>
        <li>It also block the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, so it increase their levels and may lead to serotonin syndrome (this is opposite to morphine, because morphine decreases norepinephrine)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Pharmacologic Effects</h2>
      <p>Activation of these opioid receptors lead to several central effects (CNS effects):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analgesia: tramadol has one tenth the analgesic potency of morphine, means that tramadol has equal potency with pethidine and codeine, tramadol analgesia last for 6 hours</li>
        <li>Euphoria: less euphoria than other opioids</li>
        <li>Sedation</li>
        <li>Respiratory depression: less than morphine</li>
        <li>Cough suppression</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Miosis</li>
        <li>Pruritus due to histamine release</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Activation of these opioid receptors lead to several peripheral effects including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CVS: bradycardia and hypotension</li>
        <li>GIT: constipation</li>
        <li>RS</li>
        <li>Urinary system: may lead to urine retention</li>
        <li>Immune: decrease immunity</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Therapeutic uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Used in treatment of moderate to severe pain – analgesic effect last for 6 hours</li>
        <li>Used as a second line in treatment of fibromyalgia (first line being either pregabalin or duloxetine)</li>
        <li>Also used in treatment of refractory restless legs syndrome (other opioids also effective in treatment of this condition)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Adverse effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Dry mouth</li>
        <li>Headache, drowsiness</li>
        <li>Respiratory depression</li>
        <li>Tolerance, physical dependence</li>
        <li>Numbness, tingling, paresthesia, tinnitus due to increased serotonin and norepinephrine</li>
        <li>Psychiatric symptoms: hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety, confusion due to increased serotonin</li>
        <li>It may induce seizures in epileptic patients (relative contraindication)</li>
        <li>Administration of naloxone can only partially reverse tramadol toxicity</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interactions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tramadol interact with other medications that increase serotonin levels (e.g. SSRIs) and may lead to serotonin syndrome</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Contraindications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pregnancy and lactation: due to neonatal withdrawal syndrome</li>
        <li>Children under 12 and elderly due to high risk of respiratory depression</li>
        <li>Liver and kidney failure due to accumulation</li>
      </ul>
