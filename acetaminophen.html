      <h2>Classification of analgesics</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Opioid analgesics</li>
        <li>NSAIDs</li>
        <li>Analgesics antipyretics drugs: e.g. acetaminophen, dipyrone and nefopam</li>
        <li>Non analgesic drugs that work as analgesics for some conditions: e.g. carbamazepine (antiepileptic drug) used for trigeminal neuralgia, duloxetine (antidepressant) used for diabetic neuropathy</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scientific name is acetaminophen, trade names are paracetamol, Tylenol, Panadol …</li>
        <li>Non opioid analgesic antipyretic that is used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain, it is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever in US, Europe</li>
        <li>It was synthesized in 1878 by the American chemist Northrop Morse</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Acetaminophen available oral, IV and rectal</li>
        <li>Absorption of oral formula is rapid but the drug is extensively metabolized by first pass effect and bioavailability is dose dependent (50% at 500mg and 90% at 1000mg)</li>
        <li>Metabolized by the liver via conjugation, a portion of the acetaminophen dose given will be hydroxylated to form N acetyl p benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which will react with sulfhydryl groups and cause liver damage</li>
        <li>At normal doses of acetaminophen NAPQI will react with sulfhydryl group in glutathione (produced by liver) forming non toxic substance</li>
        <li>At high doses, glutathione stores will be depleted, and NAPQI cause liver injury</li>
        <li>Excretion is mainly renal</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the brain which lead to the analgesic antipyretic effects of acetaminophen</li>
        <li>It doesn’t inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in peripheral tissues because of peripheral inactivation, that is why it has weak anti inflammatory activity</li>
        <li>Acetaminophen doesn’t affect PLT function unlike aspirin</li>
        <li>It has little to no effects on CVS, GIT, respiratory or PLT function</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Therapeutic uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is used as analgesic (for mild to moderate pain like headache, myalgia, mild MSK pain… ) and antipyretic</li>
        <li>Paracetamol in arthritis pain is not effective and if it is given, it has to be combined with ibuprofen</li>
        <li>It is useful in patients who can’t take NSAIDs because of gastric problems or they doesn’t need the extra anti inflammatory effects that comes with the NSAIDs</li>
        <li>It is very safe in pregnancy (much better than aspirin)</li>
        <li>It is used as analgesic/antipyretic in children with viral infections or chickenpox (due to risk of Reye syndrome with aspirin)</li>
        <li>Paracetamol is inferior to NSAIDs in pain relief but it is safer and better tolerated by patients</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Adverse effects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Acetaminophen is well tolerated by most people</li>
        <li>It may lead to allergic reactions (e.g. skin rash and fever)</li>
        <li>Liver damage: In toxic doses of acetaminophen (about 15 g in adults, 4 g in children), there is hepatotoxicity (centrilobular necrosis) and it is sometimes associated with renal tubular necrosis</li>
        <li>Acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure</li>
        <li>acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver via conjugation, a portion of the acetaminophen dose given will be hydroxylated to form N acetyl p benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which will react with sulfhydryl groups and cause liver damage</li>
        <li>At normal doses of acetaminophen NAPQI will react with sulfhydryl group in glutathione (produced by liver) forming non toxic substance</li>
        <li>At high doses, glutathione stores will be depleted, and NAPQI cause liver injury</li>
        <li>Early symptoms of hepatic damage include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, late symptoms include jaundice, edema… (liver failure)</li>
        <li>Patients with hepatic disease are at higher risk of hepatic damage from acetaminophen</li>
        <li>acetaminophen also lead to renal damage, hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia but those are rare</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment of acetaminophen overdose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Gastric lavage</li>
        <li>Sulfhydryl donors (N acetyl cysteine) to restore hepatic glutathione. It is most effective if started within 8 hours of the drug administration</li>
        <li>Hemodialysis: better within first 12 hours after ingestion</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Acetaminophen Dosing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dose of 325-500 mg four times daily, for children it is 10-15 mg/kg</li>
        <li>Dosing in adults should not exceed 4g/d</li>
        <li>Acetaminophen dose of 4g associated with LFTs abnormalities, so don’t exceed that dose</li>
      </ul>
